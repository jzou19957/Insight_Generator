## Summary:

This text describes the market events of May 6, 2010, focusing on the impact of a "Sell Algorithm" used by a large trader. The algorithm's sell orders, initially absorbed by high-frequency traders (HFTs) and other market intermediaries, led to a rapid decline in the price of E-Mini contracts. HFTs, after temporarily accumulating long positions, aggressively sold, contributing to the price drop. This, in turn, triggered a liquidity crisis in the E-Mini, characterized by vanishing market depth and "hot-potato" trading by HFTs. The same price drop was mirrored in the equities market, as cross-market arbitrageurs simultaneously sold SPY and other equities. 

## Fact Finding:

* "HFTs accumulated a net long position of about 3,300 contracts."
* "Between 2:41 p.m. and 2:44 p.m., HFTs aggressively sold about 2,000 E-Mini contracts in order to reduce their temporary long positions."
* "At the same time, HFTs traded nearly 140,000 E-Mini contracts or over 33% of the total trading volume."
* "Between 2:45:13 and 2:45:27, HFTs traded over 27,000 contracts, which accounted for about 49 percent of the total trading volume, while buying only about 200 additional contracts net."
* "At this time, buy-side market depth in the E-Mini fell to about $58 million, less than 1% of its depth from that morning¡¯s level."

## Claims Made:

* The Sell Algorithm used by the large trader increased the rate at which it fed orders into the market, even though previous orders were not fully absorbed.
* High trading volume is not necessarily a reliable indicator of market liquidity, especially in times of significant volatility.
* Cross-market arbitrageurs who bought E-Mini contracts simultaneously sold equivalent amounts in the equities markets.
* HFTs typically trade a large number of contracts but do not accumulate an aggregate inventory beyond three to four thousand contracts in either direction.

## Evidence Use:

* The text uses the HFTs' typical trading practices and the rapid price drop in the E-Mini as evidence for the claims about liquidity crisis and the impact of the Sell Algorithm.
* The data on trading volume and buy-side market depth provides evidence for the claims about HFT activity and the vanishing liquidity.

## Data/Statistic Used:

* HFTs accumulated a net long position of about 3,300 contracts.
* HFTs sold about 2,000 E-Mini contracts between 2:41 p.m. and 2:44 p.m.
* HFTs traded nearly 140,000 E-Mini contracts (over 33% of total volume).
* HFTs traded over 27,000 contracts (49% of total volume) between 2:45:13 and 2:45:27.
* Buy-side market depth in the E-Mini fell to about $58 million (less than 1% of morning level).
* The price of E-Mini dropped approximately 3% in four minutes.
* The price of SPY also dropped approximately 3%.

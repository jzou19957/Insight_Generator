The document states that "prices were moving so fast, fundamental buyers and cross-market arbitrageurs were either unable or unwilling to supply enough buy-side liquidity."

• **Fundamental Market Imbalance:** Fundamental sellers sold more than 80,000 contracts net, while buyers purchased only 50,000 contracts net, creating a net fundamental imbalance of 30,000 contracts.

• **Sell Algorithm and Fundamental Imbalance Contributed to the Crisis:** The Sell Algorithm's activity and the significant imbalance in fundamental market activity, with net selling outweighing net buying, amplified the price decline and liquidity crisis.
• **Automated Trading System Pauses Exacerbated the Second Liquidity Crisis:** The temporary pause of automated trading systems used by liquidity providers further contributed to the liquidity crisis in the equities market.

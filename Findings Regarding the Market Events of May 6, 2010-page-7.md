<summary>
• On May 6, 2010, market participants experienced a rapid decline in liquidity, causing price volatility in securities.
• Market makers and liquidity providers responded to perceived risk by widening spreads, reducing liquidity, or withdrawing from the market completely.
• High-frequency traders (HFTs) initially acted as net sellers during the market decline, but some continued to trade as prices recovered.
• Over-the-counter (OTC) market makers, who typically internalize orders, routed them to public exchanges where limited liquidity exacerbated price fluctuations.
• Significant volume and price dislocations occurred, with some trades executed at irrational prices due to "stub quotes" used to fulfill quoting obligations.

<fact_finding>
• "Some market makers and other liquidity providers widened their quote spreads, others reduced offered liquidity, and a significant number withdrew completely from the markets."
• "HFTs in the equity markets, who normally both provide and take liquidity as part of their strategies, traded proportionally more as volume increased, and overall were net sellers in the rapidly declining broad market along with most other participants."
• "Many over-the-counter (“OTC”) market makers who would otherwise internally execute as principal a significant fraction of the buy and sell orders they receive from retail customers (i.e., “internalizers”) began routing most, if not all, of these orders directly to the public exchanges where they competed with other orders for immediately available, but dwindling, liquidity." 
• "Between 2:40 p.m. and 3:00 p.m., approximately 2 billion shares traded with a total volume exceeding $56 billion. Over 98% of all shares were executed at prices within 10% of their 2:40 p.m. value."
• "However, as liquidity completely evaporated in a number of individual securities and ETFs, participants instructed to sell (or buy) at the market found no immediately available buy interest (or sell interest) resulting in trades being executed at irrational prices as low as one penny or as high as $100,000."

<evidence_used>
• The text provides anecdotal evidence of market participants' responses to the perceived risk of a cataclysmic event, including widening spreads, reduced liquidity, and market withdrawals.
• The text cites an increase in trading volume by HFTs as well as their net selling activity during the market decline.
• The text notes a shift in OTC market makers' order execution behavior, with internalization giving way to routing orders to public exchanges, which contributed to liquidity pressures.
• The text describes a period of high volume and price fluctuations, where the majority of trades occurred within 10% of a reference price, but highlights instances of trades executed at irrational prices due to a lack of available liquidity.

<conclusions_made>
• The rapid decline in liquidity on May 6, 2010, was a major factor driving the price volatility in the market.
• The withdrawal of liquidity providers and the subsequent increase in routing orders to exchanges created a feedback loop that exacerbated the liquidity shortage.
• The use of "stub quotes" by market makers to fulfill continuous quoting obligations in the face of market withdrawal contributed to trades occurring at irrational prices.

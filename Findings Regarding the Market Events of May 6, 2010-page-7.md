<summary>
• **Market makers and liquidity providers reacted to market uncertainty by widening spreads, reducing liquidity, and withdrawing from trading, leading to a significant decline in market liquidity.** This was driven by their fear of a potential "cataclysmic event" and the inadequacy of their strategies to handle such an event.
• **High-frequency traders (HFTs) initially increased their trading activity as volume rose, acting as net sellers in the rapidly declining market.**  However, some HFTs reduced or halted trading as the market began to recover, while others continued trading despite severe price dislocations in individual securities.
• **Over-the-counter (OTC) market makers, typically internalizing retail orders, started routing most orders directly to public exchanges due to dwindling liquidity.** This further exacerbated the liquidity crunch, leading to a competitive environment with limited available liquidity.
• **Significant price dislocations occurred in individual securities and ETFs as liquidity evaporated.** This was primarily due to sell orders (including stop-loss orders) finding limited buy interest, resulting in irrational prices ranging from one penny to $100,000.
• **"Stub quotes," generated by market makers or exchanges, contributed to the price dislocations by fulfilling continuous two-sided quoting obligations even during periods of market withdrawal.** These quotes, far from the current market, resulted in trades executed at irrational prices when real buy or sell interest was absent.

<fact_finding>
• **Market participants feared a "cataclysmic event" they were not aware of, and their strategies were not designed to handle such an event.** This fear led to significant market withdrawal and reduced liquidity.
• **Some market makers and liquidity providers widened their quote spreads, while others reduced offered liquidity, and a significant number withdrew from the markets completely.** This illustrates the drastic measures taken to manage perceived risk.
• **HFTs increased trading activity proportionally with volume growth, acting as net sellers during the initial market decline.** This highlights their role as both liquidity providers and takers, and their response to the market downturn.
• **OTC market makers, who usually internalize retail orders, started routing them to public exchanges, indicating a shift from internal execution to competing for limited liquidity.** This signifies the impact of the liquidity shortage on traditional market structures.
• **Between 2:40 p.m. and 3:00 p.m., approximately 2 billion shares traded, with over 98% executed at prices within 10% of their 2:40 p.m. value.** This demonstrates the overall market stability despite severe price dislocations in specific securities.
• **Individual securities and ETFs experienced significant price dislocations, with some trades executed at prices as low as one penny or as high as $100,000.** This exemplifies the extreme price volatility and lack of liquidity during the event.
• **"Stub quotes" generated by market makers or exchanges contributed to the price dislocations, as they fulfilled continuous two-sided quoting obligations even when market makers had withdrawn from active trading.** These quotes, far from the current market, led to trades at irrational prices.

<evidence_used>
• **The text provides detailed descriptions of the actions taken by various market participants during the event, including market makers, liquidity providers, and HFTs.** This evidence highlights the diverse responses to the perceived risk and the resulting market dynamics.
• **The text describes the increase in trading volume and the significant number of trades executed within 10% of their 2:40 p.m. value, suggesting a degree of market stability despite price dislocations in specific securities.** This evidence indicates that the overall market was not entirely dysfunctional, even with localized liquidity issues.
• **The text explains how the lack of liquidity resulted in sell orders finding limited buy interest, leading to price declines and trades executed at irrational prices.** This evidence connects the lack of liquidity to the price dislocations observed during the event.
• **The text details the use of "stub quotes" by market makers and exchanges to fulfill continuous two-sided quoting obligations.** This evidence reveals a mechanism that contributed to the irrational price movements during the liquidity crisis.

<conclusions_made>
• **The events of May 6, 2010, were significantly impacted by a combination of factors, including market participant fear, liquidity withdrawal, and the use of "stub quotes."** This conclusion underscores the complex interplay of various contributing elements.
• **The "cataclysmic event" feared by market participants was not immediately apparent, but their actions based on perceived risk had a significant impact on market liquidity and price movements.** This conclusion emphasizes the role of subjective perceptions and their influence on market behavior.
• **The use of "stub quotes" during periods of market withdrawal contributed to price dislocations and added complexity to the overall market dynamics.** This conclusion highlights the unintended consequences of seemingly standard market mechanisms during periods of stress.

<sources_used>
• **The text explicitly cites additional factors discussed in Sections 2 and 3, including the use of LRPs by the NYSE, declarations of self-help by Nasdaq against NYSE Arca, and delays in NYSE quote and trade data disseminated over the CQS and CTS data feeds.** This indicates that the text is part of a larger report or document, likely with further analysis of these factors in subsequent sections.
• **The text also references detailed reconstructions of order books presented at the end of the report, exploring the relationship between changes in immediately available liquidity and changes in stock prices.** This suggests that the text is part of a comprehensive study with further analysis of the event's impact on individual securities.

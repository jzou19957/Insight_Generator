* **Extraordinary Market Volatility:** The text describes an unprecedented market event on May 6, 2010, characterized by a sudden, sharp decline in equity prices followed by a near-instantaneous rebound. This extreme volatility, affecting both indices and individual securities, highlights the fragility and interconnectedness of the financial system.

The VIX's behavior reflects the market's reaction to the perceived risks associated with the European debt crisis.

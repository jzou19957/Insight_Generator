## Summary 

This excerpt from a report analyzing the market events of May 6, 2010, describes the behavior of different market participants during a period of rapid price declines. It highlights the withdrawal of liquidity from the market by market makers and liquidity providers who were concerned about an unknown cataclysmic event. This withdrawal led to increased trading by High-Frequency Traders (HFTs) who acted as net sellers in the declining market.  The report also describes the impact of this liquidity withdrawal on retail orders, resulting in trades at irrational prices due to "stub quotes."  

## Fact Finding 

* **"On May 6, 2010, prices in the E-Mini and SPY were recovering from their severe declines."** 
* **"Between 2:40 p.m. and 3:00 p.m., approximately 2 billion shares traded with a total volume exceeding $56 billion."**
* **"Over 98% of all shares were executed at prices within 10% of their 2:40 p.m. value."** 

## Claims Made

* **"Some market makers and other liquidity providers widened their quote spreads, others reduced offered liquidity, and a significant number withdrew completely from the markets."** 
* **"HFTs in the equity markets...traded proportionally more as volume increased, and overall were net sellers in the rapidly declining broad market along with most other participants."**
* **"Many over-the-counter (¡°OTC¡±) market makers...began routing most, if not all, of these orders directly to the public exchanges where they competed with other orders for immediately available, but dwindling, liquidity."** 
* **"Sell orders placed for some individual securities and ETFs...found reduced buying interest, which led to further price declines in those securities."** 
* **"These trades occurred as a result of so-called stub quotes, which are quotes generated by market makers (or the exchanges on their behalf) at levels far away from the current market in order to fulfill continuous two-sided quoting obligations even when a market maker has withdrawn from active trading."** 

## Evidence Use

The text relies on descriptive evidence to paint a picture of the market events, including observations about the behavior of different market participants and the impact of liquidity withdrawal on trading activity. It does not cite specific studies or reports to support its claims.

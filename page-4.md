## Summary:

This report analyzes the market events of May 6, 2010, focusing on the impact of a large, automated sell program executed by a mutual fund complex. The program, designed to sell 75,000 E-Mini contracts (valued at $4.1 billion), was intended to hedge an existing equity position. However, the algorithm, programmed to target 9% of the previous minute's trading volume without regard for price or time, executed the sell program extremely rapidly in just 20 minutes. This rapid execution, occurring amidst already high volatility and thinning liquidity, contributed to a significant decline in market liquidity and prices. The report contrasts this rapid execution with the previous large sell program by the same trader, which took over 5 hours to complete and utilized a combination of manual and automated trading strategies that considered price, time, and volume.

## Fact Finding:

* "May 6, 2010 Market Event Findings" 
* "early-morning level of about $275 million to $220 million (a 20% decline) for SPY.4"
* "a large fundamental trader (a mutual fund complex) initiated a sell program to sell a total of 75,000 E-Mini contracts (valued at approximately $4.1 billion)" 
* "The execution of this sell program resulted in the largest net change in daily position of any trader in the E-Mini since the beginning of the year (from January 1, 2010 through May 6, 2010)."
* "Only two single-day sell programs of equal or larger size - one of which was by the same large fundamental trader - were executed in the E-Mini in the 12 months prior to May 6."
* "On that occasion it took more than 5 hours for this large trader to execute the first 75,000 contracts of a large sell program."
* "However, on May 6, when markets were already under stress, the Sell Algorithm chosen by the large trader to only target trading volume, and neither price nor time, executed the sell program extremely rapidly in just 20 minutes."

## Claims Made:

* The automated sell program significantly impacted market liquidity and prices.
* The rapid execution of the sell program contributed to the already high volatility and thinning liquidity.
* The large fundamental trader used a different, more cautious approach in previous large sell programs. 

## Evidence Used:

* Comparison of the current sell program execution to previous programs by the same trader.
* Data on the size and execution time of the sell programs. 
* Description of the algorithm's parameters and its disregard for price and time.
* General observations about market conditions on May 6, 2010.

## Summary

This document describes two liquidity crises that occurred on May 6, 2010. The first occurred in the futures market, specifically the E-Mini, between 2:32 p.m. and 2:45 p.m.  During this time, a Sell Algorithm sold a significant number of contracts, contributing to a rapid price decline.  The second liquidity crisis affected the equities market around 2:45 p.m., triggered by automated trading systems pausing due to the sudden price drops in the futures market.  This led to a period of uncertainty for market participants, who had to assess risks before resuming trading.  

## Fact Finding

* "In the four-and-one-half minutes from 2:41 p.m. through 2:45:27 p.m., prices of the E-Mini had fallen by more than 5% and prices of SPY suffered a decline of over 6%." 
* "According to interviews with cross-market trading firms, at this time they were purchasing the E-Mini and selling either SPY, baskets of individual securities, or other index products."
* "At 2:45:28 there were less than 1,050 contracts of buy-side resting orders in the E-Mini, representing less than 1% of buy-side market depth observed at the beginning of the day."
* "At the same time, buy-side resting orders in SPY fell to about 600,000 shares (equivalent to 1,200 E-Mini contracts) representing approximately 25% of its depth at the beginning of the day."
* "Between 2:32 p.m. and 2:45 p.m., as prices of the E-Mini rapidly declined, the Sell Algorithm sold about 35,000 E-Mini contracts (valued at approximately $1.9 billion) of the 75,000 intended."
* "During the same time, all fundamental sellers combined sold more than 80,000 contracts net, while all fundamental buyers bought only about 50,000 contracts net, for a net fundamental imbalance of 30,000 contracts."
* "This level of net selling by fundamental sellers is about 15 times larger compared to the same 13-minute interval during the previous three days, while this level of net buying by the fundamental buyers is about 10 times larger compared to the same time period during the previous three days."
* "At 2:45:28 p.m., trading on the E-Mini was paused for five seconds when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (¡°CME¡±) Stop Logic Functionality was triggered in order to prevent a cascade of further price declines."
* "The Sell Algorithm continued to execute the sell program until about 2:51 p.m. as the prices were rapidly rising in both the E-Mini and SPY."
* "Based on interviews with a variety of large market participants, automated trading systems used by many liquidity providers temporarily paused in reaction to the sudden price declines observed during the first liquidity crisis."
* "These built-in pauses are designed to prevent automated systems from trading when prices move beyond pre-defined thresholds in order to allow traders and risk managers to fully assess market conditions before trading is resumed."

## Claims Made

* "This sudden decline in both price and liquidity may be symptomatic of the notion that prices were moving so fast, fundamental buyers and cross-market arbitrageurs were either unable or unwilling to supply enough buy-side liquidity."
* "Participants reported that these assessments included the following factors: whether observed severe price moves could be an artifact of erroneous data; the impact of such moves on risk and position limits; impacts on intraday profit and loss (¡°P&L¡±); the potential for trades to be broken, leaving their firms inadvertently long or short on one side of the market; and the ability of their systems to handle the very high volume of trades and orders they were processing that day."

## Evidence Use

The document uses evidence from interviews with cross-market trading firms and large market participants to support its claims about the causes and impact of the liquidity crises. It also cites data on trading activity during the relevant time periods.

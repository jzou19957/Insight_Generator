• **Market makers experienced significant disruptions on May 6, 2010, due to rapid price movements and market volatility.** These disruptions triggered automated trading systems to widen bid-ask spreads, reduce the number of shares offered, and, in some cases, led to a complete pause in liquidity provision.
• **Data integrity concerns were a major driver in market maker decisions regarding liquidity provision.** Rapid price movements in the E-Mini and individual securities triggered "price-driven integrity pauses," while some market makers also experienced "feed-driven integrity pauses" due to issues with consolidated market data feeds.
• **Internal systems problems further exacerbated the situation.** The overwhelming influx of data and orders caused difficulties in processing information, leading to delays in manual intervention and hindering market makers' ability to reenter the market promptly.
• **Market makers utilized stub quotes to fulfill their obligation to maintain continuous two-sided quotations.** These quotes, set at unrealistic price levels, allowed for order execution but did not reflect actual market conditions.
• **The time required for market participants to reenter the market varied significantly.** Some were able to return within a few seconds, while others took several hours to resume normal operations.

• **"On May 6, market makers reported that rapid price movements and market volatility occurring at about 2:45 p.m. caused internal risk limits to be breached."** This triggered automated trading systems to widen bid-ask spreads and reduce the number of shares offered.
• **"For some market makers, self-imposed limits to trading during rapid market moves led to an immediate pause in providing liquidity in lieu of – or soon after – widening quotes."** This indicates that some market makers proactively stopped providing liquidity to manage their risk during rapid price fluctuations.
• **"Most market makers cite d data integrity as a primary driver in their decision as to whether to provide liquidity at all, and if so, the manner (size and price) in which they would do so."** This highlights the critical role of data integrity in market maker decisions.
• **"On May 6, a number of market makers reported that rapid price moves in the E -Mini and individual securities triggered price -driven integrity pauses."** This indicates that the rapid price movements were perceived as potentially unreliable data, leading to pauses in liquidity provision.
• **"Some, who also monitor the consolidated market data feeds, reported feed -driven integrity pauses."** This suggests that issues with the data feeds themselves also contributed to liquidity disruptions.
• **"Some market makers also experienced internal systems problems on May 6."** These problems stemmed from difficulties in processing the overwhelming influx of information due to the unique market conditions of the day.
• **"In some cases, market makers that would have otherwise manually overridden their systems and continued providing liquidity were simply incapable of doing so in a timely manner due to the tremendous pressure caused by a flood of orders, executions, and market data that needed to be manually checked."** This demonstrates the significant impact of internal system overload on market maker operations.
• **"In order to comply with their obligation to maintain continuous two -sided quotations, market makers utilize stub quotes if they choose to discontinue actively quoting."** This explains how market makers fulfilled their obligations to provide continuous quotes even when they were unable to actively participate in the market.
• **"Thus, on May  6, while in the process of reassessing whether to reenter the market, some market maker quotations had extended to stub quote levels – for market makers on Nasdaq or N YSE Arca such stub quotes could be automatically generated upon a market maker’s withdrawal from the market."** This shows how stub quotes were used by market makers during the disruptions on May 6th.
• **"When available liquidity for an ETF or stock was exhausted, marketable orders executed against stub quotes, and such executions ultimately represe nted a significant"** This highlights the impact of stub quotes on order execution during periods of limited liquidity.

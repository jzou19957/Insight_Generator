<summary>
• **Cross-market strategies focus on capturing temporary price differences between related products, like futures and securities, with limited exposure to subsequent price moves.** These strategies vary widely, with some firms focusing on providing liquidity in one product and hedging in another, while others provide liquidity across multiple products.
• **Firms using these strategies may target derivative index products like futures, ETFs, and options, or they may trade baskets of underlying stocks.** Some firms engage in pure arbitrage by trading the full basket, while others use optimized baskets to reduce hedging costs or improve profitability.
• **The E-Mini, SPY, and the basket of underlying stocks in the S&P 500 Index are frequently used for cross-market trading strategies.**  Firms consider the E-Mini as the primary price discovery product for the S&P 500 Index.
• **E-Mini price changes generally lead price changes in SPY and the underlying stock basket.** On May 6, 2010, E-Mini prices led the decline, and cross-market firms purchased the E-Mini during this period.
• **Many cross-market firms ceased operating their strategies by 2:45 p.m. on May 6 due to the highly abnormal price changes in the market.** This suggests that the extreme market volatility made it difficult to execute their strategies effectively.

<fact_finding>
• "The specific nature of cross-market trading strategies varies widely." 
• "Some firms focus on 'one-way' strategies by acting as a liquidity provider (i.e., trading passively by submitting non-marketable resting orders) primarily in one product, and then hedging by trading another product (often by submitting marketable limit or market orders to trade aggressively in the hedging product)." 
• "Other firms run 'two-way' strategies that provide liquidity in multiple products and then hedge as necessary in another product."
• "According to the interviews, some firms focus on derivative index products such as futures, ETFs, and listed options, and do not trade the basket of underlying stocks."
• "Other firms, in contrast, attempt to take advantage of the increased difficulty of trading baskets of underlying stocks by specializing in strategies that trade such baskets."
• "With respect to these basket strategies, some firms engage in 'pure' arbitrage by trading/hedging in substantially the full basket of underlying stocks, while other firms use 'optimized baskets' that are designed to reduce hedging costs or otherwise improve the profitability of their cross-market strategies."
• "These firms interviewed reported that the products they most consistently used for cross-market trading strategies on May 6 and other trading days were the E-Mini, SPY, and the basket of underlying stocks in the S&P 500 Index." 
• "Consistent with the E-Mini’s very high trading volume, most of the interviewed cross-market trading firms reported that they viewed the E-Mini as the primary price discovery product for the S&P 500 Index."
• "While some firms noted that SPY has increased in importance in recent years as its trading volume has expanded, the firms agreed that price changes in the E-Mini generally lead price changes in SPY and in the basket of underlying stocks."
• "The interviewed firms reported that on May 6, E-Mini prices also led the decline and that they were purchasing the E-Mini during this period."
• "Moreover, nearly all of the interviewed large net buyers in the E-Mini market, which were engaged in cross-market arbitrage strategies, reported that during the decline in prices of the E-Mini and SPY, the E-Mini was relatively cheaper than either SPY or baskets of individual securities."
• "These same firms reported that they therefore purchased the E-Mini and contemporaneously sold SPY, baskets of individual securities, or other equity index products." 
• "Many cross-market trading firms reported that, by 2:45 p.m., they had ceased operating their cross-market strategies because of the highly abnormal price changes in the market."

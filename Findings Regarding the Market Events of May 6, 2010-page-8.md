• **Market Disruptions Were Fleeting:** While significant price dislocations occurred on May 6, 2010, market participants quickly reacted, verifying their data and systems, leading to a return of buy-side and sell-side interest, and an orderly price discovery process.
• **Automated Execution Contributed to Disruptions:** Large sell orders executed by automated algorithms without price considerations contributed to extreme price movements, eroding liquidity and causing market disorder.
• **Interconnectedness of Markets:** The interconnectedness of securities and derivatives markets, particularly with respect to index products, was highlighted. 
• **Trading Pauses Can Be Effective:** A trading pause, whether employed by individual market participants or by exchange mechanisms, can provide time for market participants to reassess strategies and allow for an orderly market to be re-established. 
• **High Trading Volume Does Not Guarantee Liquidity:** High trading volume is not always a reliable indicator of market liquidity, especially during periods of high volatility.

• **Price Disruptions Reversed:** "By approximately 3:00 p.m., most securities had reverted back to trading at prices reflecting true consensus values."
• **20,000 Trades Executed at Extreme Prices:** During a 20-minute period between 2:40 p.m. and 3:00 p.m., over 20,000 trades were executed at prices 60% or more away from their 2:40 p.m. prices.
• **Trades Cancelled Due to "Clearly Erroneous" Rules:**  Exchanges and FINRA jointly agreed to cancel trades executed during the price disruptions under their "clearly erroneous" trade rules.
• **Automated Execution Algorithms Lacked Price Considerations:** "One key lesson is that under stressed market conditions, the automated execution of a large sell order can trigger extreme price movements, especially if the automated execution algorithm does not take prices into account."
• **Interconnectedness of Securities and Derivatives Markets:** "May 6 was also an important reminder of the inter-connectedness of our derivatives and securities markets, particularly with respect to index products."
• **Trading Pauses Used by Market Participants:** "Many market participants employ their own versions of a trading pause – either generally or in particular products – based on different combinations of market signals."

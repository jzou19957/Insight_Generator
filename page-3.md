## Summary 

On May 6, 2010, US equity markets experienced a rapid and significant decline followed by a swift recovery. This event saw a 5-6% drop in major equity indices, followed by an almost equally rapid rebound. Many individual equities and ETFs mirrored this pattern, with some experiencing even more drastic fluctuations.  This event was characterized by a high number of trades executed at prices significantly deviating from their values moments before, including trades at prices as low as a penny or as high as $100,000.  While major indices eventually closed at a 3% loss from the previous day, the event highlighted the volatility and unusual market behavior on this particular date. 

## Fact Finding

* On May 6, 2010, the prices of many U.S. -based equity products experienced an extraordinarily rapid decline and recovery.
* That afternoon, major equity indices in both the futures and securities markets, each already down over 4% from their prior -day close, suddenly plummeted a further 5 -6% in a matter of minutes before rebounding almost as quickly.
* Many  of the almost 8,000  individual equity securities and exchange traded funds (¡°ETFs¡±) 
traded that day suffered similar price declines and reversals within a short period of time, 
falling 5%, 10% or even  15% before recovering most, if not all, of their losses.
* Over 20,000 tra des across more than 300 securities were executed at prices more than 60% away from their values 
just moments before. 
* Many  of these trades were executed at prices of a penny or 
less, or as high as $100,000 , before prices of those securities retur ned to their ¡°pre -crash¡± levels.
* By the end of the day, major futures and equities indices ¡°recovered¡± to close at losses of 
about  3% from the prior day.
* May 6 started as an unusually turbulent day for the markets.
* Trading in the U.S  opened to unsettling political and economic news from 
overseas concerning the European debt crisis.
* As a result, premiums rose for buying protection 
against default by the Greek government on their sovereign  debt.
* At about 1 p.m., the Euro 
began a sharp decline against both the U.S Dollar and Japanese Yen.
* Around 1:00 p.m., broadly negative market sentiment was already  affecting an increase in the 
price volatility of some individual securities.
* At that time, the number of volatility pauses, 
also known as Liquidity Replenishment Points (¡°LRPs¡±), triggered on the New York Stock 
Exchange (¡°NYSE¡±)  in individual equities listed and traded on that exchange  began to 
substantially increase above average  levels.
* By 2:30 p.m., t he S&P 500 volatility index (¡°VIX¡±) was up 22.5 percent from the opening 
level,  yields of ten -year Treasuries fell as investors engaged in a ¡°flight to quality ,¡± and selling 
pressure had pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average (¡°DJIA¡±) down abou t 2.5%.
* Furthermore , buy-side liquidity3 in the E -Mini S&P  500 futures contracts (the ¡°E -Mini¡±), as 
well as the S&P 500 SPDR exchange traded fund (¡°SPY¡±), the two most active stock index 
instruments traded in electronic futures and equity markets,  had fallen from the early -morning 
level of nearly $6 billion dollars to $2.65 billion (representing a 55% decline) for the E -Mini
